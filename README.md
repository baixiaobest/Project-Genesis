# Project-Genesis
Genesis is a series of mini-size micro-controller designed and assembled by me.
It is general purpose micro-controller using Atmega 328 chip from Atmel company.
It is 100% compatible with Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
and as powerful as currently popular Arduino Uno but less in price and smaller in size.
